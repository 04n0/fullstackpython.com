## Example Open Source Projects
The following open source projects can serve as example code for you as
you build your own applications with SQLAlchemy.


### sandman2
[sandman2](https://github.com/jeffknupp/sandman2)
([project documentation](https://sandman2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
and
[PyPI package information](https://pypi.org/project/sandman2/))
is a code library for automatically generating 
[RESTful APIs](/application-programming-interfaces.html) from
existing database schemas. This approach is handy for solving 
straightforward situations where you want to put an abstraction
layer between one or more applications and your 
[relational database](/databases.html) to prevent or reduce
direct database access.
