# Data Visualization
Data visualizations transform raw numbers into graphic formats that make it
easier for humans to see patterns, trends and other useful information.


### Data visualization resources
* [Data visualization, from 1987 to today](https://medium.economist.com/data-visualisation-from-1987-to-today-65d0609c6017)
  is a wonderful reference about the pre-computer age era of visualization
  which was a combination of cartography, art and statistics rather than
  any cohesive field as it is often seen today. The images showing how
  people worked with paper to build their visuals add fantastic context to
  the story.

* [One Chart, Twelve Charting Libraries](https://lisacharlotterost.github.io/2016/05/17/one-chart-code/)

  [Matplotlib](/matplotlib.html), [Bokeh](/bokeh.html) and Seaborn 
  compare to each other with default plotting values.

* [dataviz.tools](http://dataviz.tools/) has a nice list of categorized
  tools for working with data and visualizing it.
