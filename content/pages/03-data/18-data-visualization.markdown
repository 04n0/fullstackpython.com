# Data Visualization
Data visualizations transform raw numbers into graphic formats that make it
easier for humans to see patterns, trends and other useful information.


### Python-specific data viz resources
* The [Python Graph Gallery](https://python-graph-gallery.com/) has a slew 
  of visualizations created with Python and includes the code used to 
  produced each one.

* [10 Useful Python Data Visualization Libraries for Any Discipline](https://blog.modeanalytics.com/python-data-visualization-libraries/)
  is a straightforward overview of Python packages that create Python
  visualizations.

* [Introduction to Data Visualization with Altair](http://pbpython.com/altair-intro.html)
  is a starter post for the wonderful 
  [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) visualization tool written in
  Python.

* [A Dramatic Tour through Pythonâ€™s Data Visualization Landscape](https://dsaber.com/2016/10/02/a-dramatic-tour-through-pythons-data-visualization-landscape-including-ggplot-and-altair/)
  provides examples with the ggplot and Altair libraries. The 
  question-and-answer format for what you can do with the data is a really
  good model that keeps your attention throughout the post.

* [How to Generate FiveThirtyEight Graphs in Python](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/making-538-plots/)
  gives a great tutorial on generating a specific style graph with
  [pandas](/pandas.html) and [Matplotlib](/matplotlib.html) that is
  similar to [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/)'s plots.

* [Intro to pdvega - Plotting for Pandas using Vega-Lite](http://pbpython.com/pdvega.html)
  shows how to generate plots from your 
  [pandas](/pandas.html)-structured data using 
  [pdvega](https://github.com/altair-viz/pdvega).


### Beautiful example visualizations
Sometimes you need inspiration from other sources to figure out what
you want to build. The following links have made me excited about data
visualization and gave me ideas for what to build.

* [Roads to Rome](http://roadstorome.moovellab.com/) is a beautiful
  visualization showing the data behind the expression "all roads lead 
  to Rome" and whether or not there is a "Rome" central city in every 
  country.

* [Star Wars: The Force Accounted](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-star-wars-the-force-accounted/)
  is Bloomberg's way of breaking down on-screen action between light
  and dark sides, the main characters, various bits about the Force
  and other data extracted from the movies.

* [Big League Graphs](https://bigleaguegraphs.com/) presents a bunch of
  creative ways to view data for sports such as basketball, baseball and
  hockey.

* [Bay Area Housing Marketing Analysis: Part 1](https://blog.checkyo.tech/2018/08/06/bay-area-housing-market-analysis/)
  and
  [Part 2](https://blog.checkyo.tech/2018/08/15/bay-area-housing-market-analysis-part-2/)
  are a combination of inspiration and tutorial. These posts contain a 
  ton of data analysis and graphing and show numerous ways to slice and 
  present information.

* [How We Animated Trillions of Tons of Flowing Ice](http://dwtkns.com/posts/flowing-ice.html)
  breaks down the process that the NY Times data team used to create the
  beautiful 
  [Antarctic Dispatches](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/05/18/climate/antarctica-ice-melt-climate-change.html)
  articles that show how glaciers and ice are moving.


### Data visualization resources
* [Data visualization, from 1987 to today](https://medium.economist.com/data-visualisation-from-1987-to-today-65d0609c6017)
  is a wonderful reference about the pre-computer age era of visualization
  which was a combination of cartography, art and statistics rather than
  any cohesive field as it is often seen today. The images showing how
  people worked with paper to build their visuals add fantastic context to
  the story.

* [One Chart, Twelve Charting Libraries](https://lisacharlotterost.github.io/2016/05/17/one-chart-code/)
  compares how charting libraries such as [D3.js](/d3-js.html),
  [Matplotlib](/matplotlib.html), [Bokeh](/bokeh.html) and Seaborn 
  compare to each other with default plotting values.

* [dataviz.tools](http://dataviz.tools/) has a nice list of categorized
  tools for working with data and visualizing it.

* [Xenographics](https://xeno.graphics/) presents uncommon and unusual
  visualization formats such as the 
  [Manhattan Plot](https://xeno.graphics/manhattan-plot/) and
  [Time Curve](https://xeno.graphics/time-curve/).

* [Engineering Intelligence Through Data Visualization at Uber](https://eng.uber.com/data-viz-intel/)
  explains how Uber's data visualization team grew from 1 person to 15
  and the output they created along the way, including the open source
  tools [react-vis](https://uber.github.io/react-vis/) and 
  [react-map-gl](https://uber.github.io/react-map-gl/).
