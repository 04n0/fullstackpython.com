# Web App Performance
Web application performance is affected by network latency, bandwidth, 
database queries, page size and many other factors.


### Load testing resources
* [Load Testing with Locust.io & Docker Swarm](https://wheniwork.engineering/load-testing-with-locust-io-docker-swarm-d78a2602997a)
  shows you how to set up load tests using [Docker](/docker.html) containers
  along with AWS for scaling up the tests.

* [HTTP Load Testing with Vegeta (and a dash of Python)](https://serialized.net/2017/06/load-testing-with-vegeta-and-python/)
  covers getting started with the [Vegeta](https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta)
  load tester and uses Python to analyze the tool's results.

  and 
  [four load testing mistakes developers love to make](https://engineering.klarna.com/four-load-testing-mistakes-developers-love-to-make-68b443f7e8a2)
  are opinionated pieces on how developer should use load testing to
  ensure their applications work properly under heavy usage.



### Web app performance resources
* [A Primer in Web Performance](https://kiboit.com/performance) is a quick,
  straightforward one pager on why the topic matters and what causes bad
  website performance.
