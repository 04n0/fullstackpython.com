### Kubernetes resources
* [Borg, Omega and Kubernetes](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2898444)
  goes into the history of Borg and Omega, projects that preceded 
  Kubernetes' creation. There are a ton of great notes on why they developed
  the project in certain ways and what they knew to avoid based on the
  prior work on Borg and Omega.

* [Kubernetes The Hard Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way)
  is a tutorial that walks you through manually setting up a Kubernetes
  cluster. The purpose is to teach you what is happening at each step instead 
  of performing everything through automation like you normally would after
  you understand how to use the tool.

* [Kubernetes by Example](http://kubernetesbyexample.com/) provides the 
  commands and code for you to get started with the core Kubernetes concepts.
