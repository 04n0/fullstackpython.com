Website security must be incorporated into building every level of the web 
stack. However, I include a separate section here for topics that deserve 
a comprehensive review such as firewalls, SSL certificates, and public key
authorization.

Key Terms
---------
*Authorization* - specifying access rights and permissions to server and 
application resources. For example, a non-logged in user can view a landing
page but only a logged in user can access an application's "account" screen.
