I'm `Matt Makai <http://www.mattmakai.com/>`_ and I solve problems by 
developing software. I often use Python and occasionally work with 
languages in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) stack.

In 2013 I traveled to 30 cities in the United States to visit with
tech companies, attend and speak at tech meetups, and blog from an experienced
software developer's perspective about the current state of technology in the
United States. 

Read more about my trip on my 
`Coding Across America <http://www.codingacrossamerica.com/>`_ website.
