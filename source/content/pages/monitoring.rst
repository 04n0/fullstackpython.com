Capturing and analyzing data about your production environment is critical
to proactively deal with stability, performance, and errors in a web 
application.

There are several important resources to monitor on the operating system 
and network level of a web stack.

1. CPU utilization
2. Memory utilization
3. Persistence storage consumed versus free
4. Network bandwidth and latency

Application level monitoring encompasses several aspects. The amount of time
and resources dedicated to each aspect will vary based on whether an 
application is read-heavy, write-heavy, or subject to rapid swings in traffic.

1. Application warnings and errors (500-level HTTP errors)
2. Application code performance
3. Template rendering time
4. Browser rendering time for the application
5. Database querying performance
