You're knee deep in learning the `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_
programming language. The syntax is beginning to make sense. The first
few "AHA!" moments are hitting you. Now you are excited for direction to learn
more.

So now what? Definitely read Kenneth Reitz's 
`The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Python <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/>`_
if you have not already. If you're not coming from a development background,
I wrote a `Learning Python <http://www.mattmakai.com/learning-python-for-non-developers.html>`_ blog post.
    
This guide has a different focus from the above resources. This site 
describes the myriad ways of setting up a Python *web application*
stack from a "bare metal" server, virtual private server (VPS), Amazon Web 
Services (AWS) instance, or Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) provider up 
through the JavaScript running on users' browsers on your website.

About the Author
----------------
I'm `Matt Makai <http://www.mattmakai.com/>`_ and I develop software in
Washington, DC. I currently work most often in Python and occasionally in
the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) stack.

In 2013 I will be traveling to 30 cities in the United States to visit with
tech companies, speak at tech meetups, and blog from an experienced
software developer's perspective about the current state of technology in the
United States. If you're reading this guide, I'd love to meet with you
during my trip from March through August, so send me an email at
matthew.makai@gmail.com or 
`message me on Twitter <https://twitter.com/makaimc>`_. Read more about
my upcoming trip at 
`Coding Across America <http://www.codingacrossamerica.com/about.html>`_.

If there are typos, inaccurate statements, or general areas for improvement
that you see in this guide, please issue a 
`pull request on this website's Github repository <https://github.com/makaimc/fullstackpython.github.com/pull/new/gh-pages>`_. Thank you!
