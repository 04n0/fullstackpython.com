You're knee deep in learning the `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_
programming language. The syntax is beginning to make sense. The first
few "AHA!" moments are hitting you. Now you are excited for direction to learn
more.

Now what? Definitely read Kenneth Reitz's 
`The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Python <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/>`_
if you have not already. 
    
This guide has a different focus from the Hitchhiker's Guide. This site 
describes the myriad ways of setting up a Python *web application*
stack from a bare-bones server, VPS, Amazon Web Services instance, or 
Platform-as-a-Service provider up through the JavaScript running on 
users' browsers on your website.
