You're knee deep in learning the `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_
programming language. The syntax is beginning to make sense. The first
few "AHA!" moments are hitting you. Now you are excited for continued 
direction to accelerate your learning.

This guide explains each piece of a Python web stack. If you want to deploy
a web application built with Django, Flask, Pyramid, or another
Python-based web framework, you've come to the right place.

There are a few other fantastic Python guides that you may want to read if
you're not yet ready to deploy your application.

For general Python learning, read Kenneth Reitz's 
`The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Python <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/>`_.

To deploy a Python web application to the Heroku platform-as-a-service 
(described below in this guide), check out 
`Deploying Django <http://www.deploydjango.com/>`_.

If you're not coming in with any software development background, 
you may find my post on 
`Learning Python <http://www.mattmakai.com/learning-python-for-non-developers.html>`_ 
useful.

This guide has a different focus from the above resources. Here I 
focus on explaining several ways of for how the Python *web application*
stack works from server infrastructure through JavaScript execution on a 
user's browser.

People learning Python generally have at least one of the three following
goals:

1. Build web applications
2. Perform data analysis
3. Script server administration

This guide will be most useful to people in the first and third categories.
