Operating System
================

The operating system sits directly on top of the server or virtual server
and provides access to computing resources. The only operating
system I can recommend for production Python web stack deployments is
a flavor of Linux. Ubuntu Long Term Support (LTS) releases, Red Hat 
Enterprise Linux, and CentOS are all viable options. 

*Side note*: Mac OS X is fine for development activities but not for 
test/production deployments.

Ubuntu
------
Ubuntu is a Linux distribution packaged by the 
`Canonical Ltd <http://www.canonical.com/>`_ company. Ubuntu uses the
Debian distribution as a base for packages, including the `aptitude package
manager <http://wiki.debian.org/Apt>`_. For desktop versions of Ubuntu, 
GNOME (until the 11.04 release) or Unity (11.10 through current)
is added to the distribution to provide a user interface.


Red Hat and CentOS
------------------
Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and Community enterprise Operating 
System (CentOS) are essentially the same distribution. The key 
difference is that CentOS is an open source free derivative of RHEL.
