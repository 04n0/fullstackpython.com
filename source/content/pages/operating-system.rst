Operating System
================

The operating system sits directly on top of the server or virtual server
and provides access to computing resources. The only operating
system I can recommend for production Python web stack deployments is
a flavor of Linux. Ubuntu Long Term Support (LTS) releases, Red Hat, and 
CentOS are all viable options. (Side note: Mac OS X is fine for development
activities but not for test/production deployments.)
