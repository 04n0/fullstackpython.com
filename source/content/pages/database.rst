A database provides an abstraction on top of a file system for creating,
reading, updating, and deleting persistent data. The abstraction most
commonly represented is a set of relational tables, known as a 
relational database management system (RDBMS). Alternative abstractions
include graph databases where data is stored in both nodes and edges of a 
graph.

Database resources
------------------
`PostgreSQL <http://www.postgresql.org/>`_ and 
`MySQL <http://www.mysql.com/>`_ are two of the most common open source
databases.

`SQLite <http://www.sqlite.org/>`_ is a database that is stored in a single
file on disk. SQLite is built into Python but is only built for access
by a single connection at a time.
